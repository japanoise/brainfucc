# brainfucc
Just another brainfuck interpretor,

## So what's so special about this one?

1. Sane build system (makefile)
2. Infinite tape
3. Small test suite

OK, so it's not that special. It's more for fun.
However, I'm sure you'll get some use out of it.

## Building and Running

Run make. There's no target for install yet, but it's planned.
Pass brainfucc a file to open, or crunchbang your brainfuck sources.
